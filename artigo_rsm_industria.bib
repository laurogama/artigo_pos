Wireless sensor network operate in license-free Industrial Scientific and Medical(ISM) band hence share the spectrum with other technologies. In IWSN link failure occur because of multipath propogation from metallic surfaces, excessive electromagnetic noise and asymmetric capabilities. However, for industrial applications, new requirements such as reliable (in-time) delivery is a main constraint. A survey on industrial wireless sensor networks is presented.},

abstract = {A complete dynamic wideband channel model for industrial wireless sensor network is presented. The model takes into account the noise, interferences, and heavy multipath propagation effects present in harsh industrial environments. A first-order two-state Markov process is adopted to describe the typical bursty nature of the impulsive noise usually present in industrial environments. The interference effects are modeled as multiple narrowband signals operating on the same frequency band as the desired signal. The multipath propagation is described by assuming the scatterers to be uniformly distributed in space within an elliptical region where the transmitting and receiving nodes are located at the foci of the ellipse. Furthermore, performance evaluations of IEEE 802.15.4 in terms of bit error rate using the developed channel model are presented. The results show that in addition to spread spectrum techniques, link diversity can further improve the link quality in harsh industrial environments.},

@article{Woo2008,
abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence estimating an impact of occupational factors on mood disorders and suicide, and the efficacy of interventions. This review is based on literature searches using Medline and Psych INFO from 1966 to 2007 (keywords: work stress, job insecurity, job strain, shift work, violence, occupational health, mood disorders, depression, and suicide). To establish the relationship between occupational variables and mood disorders, we focused on clinically significant disorders rather than depressive symptoms. During the last decade, prospective epidemiological studies have suggested a predictive association between the work environment and mood disorders. Recently, increasing numbers of clinical trials have shown favorable effect size of intervention and suggested preferable return-on-investment results. However, low awareness and social stigma still decrease workers access to treatment. Mental health professionals in conjunction with employers have to devise a creative system to make the quality care being offered more accessible to employees. In addition, further outcome data is needed to evaluate the benefit of managing mood disorders in the workplace, and to foster awareness of positive implications for employees, employers, their families, and the society at large. In addition, the work environment, with its chemical (e.g. chemosensory factors, pollutants), physical (e.g. lighting, noise, temperature, outdoor views and activities), biological (e.g., chronobiological factors, allergens, infectious agents), psychological (e.g. demand-control, effort-reward balance), social (e.g. cohesiveness, support), and organizational (e.g. leadership styles) component should meet minimal standards, and may improve with striving towards the optimum.},

@article{Fielding2000,
abstract = {The World Wide Web has succeeded in large part because its software architecture has been designed to meet the needs of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system. The Web has been iteratively developed over the past ten years through a series of modifications to the standards that define its architecture. In order to identify those aspects of the Web that needed improvement and avoid undesirable modifications, a model for the modern Web architecture was needed to guide its design, definition, and deployment. Software architecture research investigates methods for determining how best to partition a system, how components identify and communicate with each other, how information is communicated, how elements of a system can evolve independently, and how all of the above can be described using formal and informal notations. My work is motivated by the desire to understand and evaluate the architectural design of network-based application software through principled use of architectural constraints, thereby obtaining the functional, performance, and social properties desired of an architecture. An architectural style is a named, coordinated set of architectural constraints. This dissertation defines a framework for understanding software architecture via architectural styles and demonstrates how styles can be used to guide the architectural design of network-based application software. A survey of architectural styles for network-based applications is used to classify styles according to the architectural properties they induce on an architecture for distributed hypermedia. I then introduce the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style and describe how REST has been used to guide the design and development of the architecture for the modern Web. REST emphasizes scalability of component interactions, generality of interfaces, independent deployment of components, and intermediary components to reduce interaction latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems. I describe the software engineering principles guiding REST and the interaction constraints chosen to retain those principles, contrasting them to the constraints of other architectural styles. Finally, I describe the lessons learned from applying REST to the design of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Uniform Resource Identifier standards, and from their subsequent deployment in Web client and server software.},

@phdthesis{Ribeiro2010,
abstract = {For the past years wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been coined as one of the most promising technologies for supporting a wide range of applications. However, outside the research community, few are the people who know what they are and what they can offer. Even fewer are the ones that have seen these networks used in real world applications. The main obstacle for the proliferation of these networks is energy, or the lack of it. Even though renewable energy sources are always present in the networks environment, designing devices that can efficiently scavenge that energy in order to sustain the operation of these networks is still an open challenge. Energy scavenging, along with energy efficiency and energy conservation, are the current available means to sustain the operation of these networks, and can all be framed within the broader concept of “Energetic Sustainability”. A comprehensive study of the several issues related to the energetic sustainability of WSNs is presented in this thesis, with a special focus in today’s applicable energy harvesting techniques and devices, and in the energy consumption of commercially available WSN hardware platforms. This work allows the understanding of the different energy concepts involving WSNs and the evaluation of the presented energy harvesting techniques for sustaining wireless sensor nodes. This survey is supported by a novel experimental analysis of the energy consumption of the most widespread commercially available WSN hardware platforms.},
